# C++98
C++98 is the first official standard version of the C++ programming language and is designated as the ISO/IEC 14882:1998 standard. C++98 is a document that defines the basic features of the C++ language and contains its standard library. This standard unites the various components of the C++ language, the language's constructs, and its standard library on a common basis.

C++98 introduced standardization, replacing previous informal versions of C++ (previous versions developed during the evolution of C++). This standard defines various aspects of the language and guides programmers on how the language should be used.

C++98 standards include the core language features and standard library, but are more limited than later standards. As the evolution of the C++ language continues, some of the shortcomings and weaknesses of C++98 have been corrected in later standards. C++98 formed the basis of the language, providing a framework for C++ programmers and laying the foundation for standardization of the language.

# Headers
|  Header   | Description   |
| :-------- | :------------ |
| [`<algorithm>`](headers/algorithm.md) | Header file for algorithms. It includes general algorithms such as `sorting`, `searching`, `comparing`. |
| [`<bitset>`](headers/bitset.md) | Header file for bit set operations. It contains a `data type` that represents a `set of bits`. |
| [`<deque>`](headers/deque.md) | Header file for the double-ended queue (`deque`) data structure. Similar to Vector, but can be added and removed from the beginning and end. |
| [`<exception>`](headers/exception.md) | Header file for exception handling. It supports exception handling such as `try-catch` blocks and `throw` statements. |
| [`<fstream>`](headers/fstream.md) | Header file for file input/output operations. It is used to perform `reading and writing` operations on `files`. |
| [`<functional>`](headers/functional.md) | Header file for function objects and their functionality. Contains tools related to `function objects` and `their functionality`. |
| [`<iomanip>`](headers/iomanip.md) | Header file to format input/output operations. It includes functions such as `std::setw`, `std::setprecision`. |
| [`<ios>`](headers/ios.md) | Header file for basic input/output operations. Contains base classes for `I/O operations`. |
| [`<iosfwd>`](headers/iosfwd.md) | Forward declaration header file for input/output operations. Contains `forward declarations of classes`. |
| [`<iostream>`](headers/iostream.md) | Header file for input/output operations. Contains `standard input/output objects` such as `std::cin` and `std::cout`. |
| [`<istream>`](headers/istream.md) | Header file for login operations. Supports `input operations` like `std::cin`. |
| [`<iterator>`](headers/iterator.md) | Header file for Iterator operations. It `includes iterator operations` such as `begin()`, `end()`, `advance()`.|
| [`<limits>`](headers/limits.md) | Header file that specifies properties of numeric types. It includes features such as `min` and `max` values. |
| [`<list>`](headers/list.md) | Header file for the linked list data structure. It supports `forward and reverse` element `addition and removal` operations. |
| [`<locale>`](headers/locale.md) | Header file for localization operations. It includes localization processes such as `language`, `region` and `culture`. |
| [`<map>`](headers/map.md) | Header file for binary search tree based map data structure. It works with `key-value pairs`. |
| [`<memory>`](headers/memory.md) | Header file for memory management. Includes tools such as `smart pointers` (`std::shared_ptr`, `std::unique_ptr`). |
| [`<new>`](headers/new.md) | Header file for memory management operators. Supports memory operations such as `new` and `delete`.|
| [`<numeric>`](headers/numeric.md) | Header file for numerical algorithms. It includes operations such as `std::accumulate`, `std::inner_product`. |
| [`<ostream>`](headers/ostream.md) | Header file for output operations. Supports `output operations` like `std::cout`. |
| [`<queue>`](headers/queue.md) | Header file for the queue data structure. It works with `FIFO (First-In-First-Out) sorting`. |
| [`<sstream>`](headers/sstream.md) | Header file for string streams. It involves `input/output operations` on the `string`. |
