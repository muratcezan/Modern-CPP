# Moden C++
This repository aim that how to use `Moden C++` and how developers apply effective skills to projects. You can also see example codes and video tutorials.

## What is Modern C++?
The term Moden C++ refers to the use the latest and uppdate techniques with C++. These updates started to add with C++11.

| Version | Standard | Description |
| :------ | :------- | :---------- |

| [C++03](cpp03/README.md) | ISO/IEC 14882:2003 | It is a revision of C++98 with bug fixes and fixes. It is basically a revised version of C++98. |
| [C++11](cpp11/README.md) | ISO/IEC 14882:2011 | It is a major release that brings major language expansion and modernization. Many important features such as smart pointers, lambda expressions, range-based for loop have come with this version. |
| [C++14](cpp14/README.md) | ISO/IEC 14882:2014 | It is a version containing additions and corrections to C++11. While this version continues the evolution of the language, it does not contain major changes. |
